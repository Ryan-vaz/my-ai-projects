## üéß Transcription Script

This is a simple Python script that **automatically transcribes audio into text** using powerful AI models. It helps convert spoken words into written form, making it easier to work with recordings like interviews, lectures, or voice notes.

---

### ‚ú® Features

* Converts audio files (like `.mp3`, `.wav`) into text
* Uses [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) or similar transcription model
* Fast and accurate speech recognition
* Easy to use from the command line

---

### üîß How It Works

The script takes an audio file, runs it through an AI model, and saves the spoken content as text in a `.txt` file.

---

### üß∞ Tools & Technologies

* Python
* OpenAI Whisper (or another transcription model)
* PyTorch
* `ffmpeg` (for processing audio files)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**
   Download the script to your machine.

2. **Install requirements**
   Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install `ffmpeg`**
   If not already installed, get it from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

4. **Run the script**
   Replace `yourfile.mp3` with your actual audio filename:

   ```bash
   python transcribe.py yourfile.mp3
   ```

5. **Output**
   A text file (e.g., `yourfile.txt`) will be created with the transcribed text.

### üìÅ Example

```bash
python transcribe.py lecture.mp3
```

This will generate a file `lecture.txt` with all the spoken content transcribed.

### ‚úÖ To Do / Improvements

* Add support for more file formats
* GUI version for easier use
* Support for different languages and accents
