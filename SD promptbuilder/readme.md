## üß† PromptBuilder

**PromptBuilder** is a simple Python tool that helps you **create consistent and reusable prompts** for AI models like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, or other LLMs/image generators. Instead of rewriting the same text over and over, this script helps you save, load, and combine prompt elements quickly.
