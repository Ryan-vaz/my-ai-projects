# Kpop Album Scraper

This Python script extracts album listings from kpopalbums.com and outputs them in JSON format. 
I built it as a learning exercise for web scraping and product data grouping.

## Features
- Gets all product URLs from the first listing page
- Groups variations like photocard versions
- Outputs clean JSON
